# Codinity

**_An educational video sharing platform bringing the Code and the Community together!_**

## Motivation

The idea behind Codinity is to basically provide a platform for college going students to explore and share their knowledge on various topics related to computer science through video lectures. We have seen that there is always a gap between the student who is learning and the instructor who is teaching. To bridge that gap, why not let students take control? Students learning and teaching at the same time, sharing knowledge and generating ideas only to learn and discover even more amazing stuff.
